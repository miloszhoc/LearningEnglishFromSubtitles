It's always blue.

39
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,012
Are you looking for him,

40
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:45,380
my lovelies?

41
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:48,016

42
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:51,186
Did you hear his message? No?

43
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:55,257
If you have the skill, you
can go back and listen again.

Come on.

111
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,480
We've been waiting for you.

112
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,037
For me?

113
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,939
For everyone.

114
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:28,143
But especially you.

115
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:30,045
Where is this place?

116
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:31,290
I'm not sure.

117
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,180
My queen brought me here,

118
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:36,184
she of the frosted breakfast flakes.

119
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,671
We're gonna have a baby.

120
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,324
What is that?

121
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,193
Peace. Love.

122
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,896
He makes it. In here.

123
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:17,959
He's the Dream-Come-True-Man.

124
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,361
His thoughts are magic.

125
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:26,458
It's prayers mixed with dreams.

126
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:31,338
His spirit is the music

127
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,519
and the word.

128
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,009
What did it mean, "Don't
trust the mustache"?

129
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:37,212
And who's the basket?

130
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,380
And what are the forces
of multiplication?

131
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:42,117
Soon. He'll tell you everything.

132
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,386
But you're not ready yet.

133
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:47,457
Your mind has to open...

134
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,560
like a flower.

135
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,938
It takes time.

136
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:08,076
Do you know that word?

137
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,044
"Time"?

138
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,363
That's Squirrel.

139
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:31,132
He's the alchemist.

140
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,905
Greetings, earthlings.

141
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:39,240
Like your vibe.

142
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:42,277
Very two days from now.

143
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,280
Jia-yi.

144
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,384
No. That's not it.

145
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:55,990
We shall call you...

146
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,992
Switch.

147
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:00,175
And Switch

148
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,757
shall be your name.

149
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:33,895
Are you really a virgin?

150
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:36,898
Penis-free, 25 years.

151
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,067
This is where you wait.

152
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,513
She'll be here soon.

153
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,970
She?

154
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,972
"S" before "H."

155
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,007
My beloved,

156
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,009
the master of disaster.

157
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,055
- Her majesty.
- The breakfast queen.

158
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,370
Sorry for the wait.

159
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,995
Was it awful?

160
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:43,097
Not too bad.

161
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,120
So...

162
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,022
sad runaway

163
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,091
or spoiled daddy's girl?

164
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,259
Is this a cult?

165
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:12,927
Yes.

166
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,300
Are you the leader?

167
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,173
I'm Lenny.

168
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:27,108
And you are?

169
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:30,111
Switch.

170
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:31,879
Switch-hitter.

171
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,467
Do you swing?

172
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,116
I like boys.

173
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:38,052
Why?

174
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,355
Okay.

175
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:42,223
Never mind.

176
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,325
What do you want, Switcheroo?

177
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,364
A Band-Aid for your boo-boo?

178
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,898
I'm not looking for you.

179
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,901
You're looking for me.

180
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,204
"Are you a time traveler?

181
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:59,173
The forces of multiplication need you."

182
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,885
Prove it.

183
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,153
Not to you.

184
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,122
To him.

185
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,076
Hi.

186
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:52,078
I'm David.

187
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Come on in.

188
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,315
I'll make some tea.

189
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:03,089
What is this place?

190
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,192
People have their pain.

191
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:08,195
Their hearts are sad.
Their minds are tired.

192
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,197
I help them.

193
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,199
How?

194
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm the magic man.

195
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,761
All I ask

196
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:20,407
is that they stay and
keep me company after.

197
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:24,411
Take care of the house.

198
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,217
Love each other.

199
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,419
I need that.

200
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:34,154
Love.

201
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,394
How is this here?

202
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,331
This... cave?

203
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,166
I made it.

204
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,037
Try this.

205
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,472
Close your eyes.

206
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:57,043
Close your eyes.

207
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,313
And picture your bedroom.

208
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:02,415
Your bed.

209
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,351
Can you see it?

210
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,054
Really see it?

211
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:10,290
The walls, the windows?

212
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:13,126
The way the light falls?

213
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,062
Open your eyes.

214
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:29,042
It's a mental space.

215
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:31,378
You imagined it. I made it real.

216
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:36,016
You read my mind?

217
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,318
No secrets.

218
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,121
That's one of our rules.

219
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:43,456
What about trust?

220
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,159
Mm. I tried that,

221
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,262
and it's better to read people's minds.

222
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,167
I'm adopted.

223
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:56,436
When I was a baby,

224
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,271
a monster snuck into my head

225
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:02,208
and haunted me for 33 years.

226
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,415
But I'm better now.

227
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,417
How are you?

228
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,020
Good. I'm good.

229
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,839
How are you?

230
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:22,996
You know. Fine.

231
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,406
How are you?

232
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,524
My dad collects robots.

233
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:49,389
Robotto.

234
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,590
There's a room in our apartment.

235
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,708
Some are life-sized.

236
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,144
Some toys.

237
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:58,080
Hundreds.

238
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:02,135
Sometimes at night, I go in there.

239
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,441
I stand very still,

240
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:12,012
and pretend I'm a robot, too.

241
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,026
So what are "the forces of division"?

242
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:28,294
Why do you need a time traveler?

243
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,208
So it's a girl thing.

244
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,212
You want to go back in time and... what?

245
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:49,149
Get your girlfriend back?

246
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,484
I thought about it.

247
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:56,289
Doing everything again, making
different choices, but...

248
00:23:57,492 --> 00:24:00,160
...it won't work.

249
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:03,163
You know how sometimes you can
be so sure what the problem is

250
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:06,166
and then you realize the
problem is really something else?

251
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,367
No.

252
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:11,171
Oh. Well, you're young.

253
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:13,373
When I was in the psych ward,

254
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,076
everybody was so sure the
problem was neurological.

255
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:17,681
Brain chemistry, serotonin.

256
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:19,434
"David Haller, schizophrenic."

257
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:21,314
You were in a psychiatric hospital?

258
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:25,151
Oh. Oh. Lots of times.

259
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:28,054
Psych hospitals, emergency rooms.

260
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:31,257
"David, don't swallow all
your mother's diet pills."

261
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,426
"David, don't huff the
chemicals under the sink."

262
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,261
Like I'm supposed to... what?

263
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:38,264
Pretend the voices
aren't real? You know?

264
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,689
- Yeah, sure.
- You see, like I said,

265
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:42,435
when I was a baby, a
monster came into my head

266
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,438
and haunted me for, like, 33 years.

267
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,443
By "monster," you mean,
like, a metaphor, right?

268
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:55,982
Amahl Farouk. The Shadow King.

269
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:59,625
My dad, my real dad,

270
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,531
he kicked Farouk out of his
body into the astral plane.

271
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,225
And then he found me... Farouk...

272
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:09,129
and he moved in.

273
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,299
More tea?

274
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:46,464
I still don't know why
you need a time traveler.

275
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,300
To go back in time.

276
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:49,768
What else?

277
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,339
- How far?
- Well, how far can you go?

278
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,459
Stay down, kid.

279
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:46,733
_

280
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,896
_

281
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,266
_

282
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,627
_

283
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:05,032
_

284
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,371
_

285
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,862
_

286
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:16,095
_

287
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,003
_

288
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,561
_

289
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,438
_

290
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,736
_

291
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:44,841
_

292
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,908
_

293
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:55,024
_

294
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:06,565
- Her majesty...
- The breakfast queen.

295
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,341
Prove it.

296
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:18,544
To him.

297
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:33,425
I'm David.

298
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:35,327
Come on in.

299
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:36,695
I'll make some tea.

300
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,647
Yes, it pays to be kind.

301
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,163
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,427
"Is black tea okay?" What are
you gonna do with this one?

303
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,509
Give her a wee nib of the blue stuff

304
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,123
and sling her in with all the others?

305
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:56,615
Shall we sit out here?

306
00:30:56,617 --> 00:31:00,619
I'm excited to talk to you,
hear what brought you to us.

307
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:02,588
We don't have time for that.

308
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:07,811
Lenny says you grew up in the city.

309
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:09,113
They're coming.

310
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,430
The forces of division.
They're almost here.

311
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,533
I've seen them.

312
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,535
They kill you.

313
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:21,306
No. I'd hear them.

314
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:24,576
You didn't last time.

315
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,494
What do you mean, "last time"?

316
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:29,564
"Time traveler wanted."

317
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:32,417
You wrote that.

318
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,554
"Find the pregnant virgin."

319
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:38,444
Well, I did. I'm here.

320
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:40,392
And we got to go...

321
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,506
Oh, David!

322
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:35,747
Stick with me.

323
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:42,387
Come on.

324
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,463
David!

325
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:01,473
This way!

326
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:18,777
You're cheating.

327
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:34,793
A time traveler.

328
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,563
C'est magnifique.

329
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:40,799
I had relations with
a time traveler once.

330
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,835
Geraldine.

331
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:47,740
Is it true that you are always women?

332
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:50,542
Pourquoi?

333
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:53,879
Maybe it has something
to do with regret.

334
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,815
Choices made and not made.

335
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:59,752
Opportunities missed.

336
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:02,554
I'm not supposed to be here.

337
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:05,991
Wherever this is.

338
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:08,660
This is...

339
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:10,496
the astral plane.

340
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,765
A world beyond the world.

341
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,900
Made of pure energy.

342
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:18,570
Very few can see it.

343
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:20,706
David, for example.

344
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,843
Oh, you know him.

345
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,712
David Haller.

346
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:33,519
He used to be easy to find.

347
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,722
His power was so loud

348
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:38,924
and no control.

349
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:41,493
But now...

350
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:49,582
Is this a...

351
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:51,736
mental space?

352
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,606
Did you make this?

353
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:00,846
I was looking for David...

354
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:03,715
and saw you.

355
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,851
Your... trail.

356
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:08,645
See?

357
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:11,856
The realms of time and space...

358
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:14,827
collide here in the plane.

359
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,829
Now...

360
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:19,258
the first time I see you,

361
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,766
I think, "Interesting."

362
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,702
But the second time...

363
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,473
You're helping him, no?

364
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:33,274
I don't know what you're talking about.

365
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,680
We, too, want to help him.

366
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:38,851
He's a very sick young man.

367
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:41,486
Then why did she shoot him?

368
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:42,888
The blonde?

369
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:48,861
You have seen this?

370
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:53,765
So we find him...

371
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,735
and you go back to change what happens.

372
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:00,671
- I have to go.
- To warn him.

373
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:03,775
What does he have that you need?

374
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:07,779
Maybe we can make a
different arrangement.

375
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,782
Tell me.

376
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,751
Why are you helping him?

377
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,543
_

378
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,414
_

379
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,148
_

380
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:28,497
_

381
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:31,802
_

382
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:37,843
Ah...

383
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:09,474
Time to symbiosis T-minus 45.

384
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:12,248
- I'm hungry.
- Not now.

385
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,814
That's right, I forgot
you're making a person.

386
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:18,650
It's not a person.
It's a fully synthetic

387
00:38:18,652 --> 00:38:20,152
bipedal quantum computer.

388
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:22,135
Yeah, but it looks a lot
like somebody we know.

389
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:24,489
Initiating cranial fusion.

390
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:25,824
Time to symbiosis...

391
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,659
...T-minus 30.

392
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,573
Why does he have a mustache?

393
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,841
I don't know, I...

394
00:38:42,843 --> 00:38:45,215
Time to symbiosis, T-minus 15.

395
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:46,551
Calibrating synchronicity.

396
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:49,165
Beginning data transfer.

397
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,912
Sentience in ten...

398
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,588
nine...

399
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,590
eight...

400
00:38:58,592 --> 00:38:59,925
seven...

401
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:02,627
- six...
- Wonder if he'll still be grouchy.

402
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:03,929
- Shh.
- ...five...

403
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:05,964
four...

404
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:07,866
three...

405
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,701
two...

406
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:11,039
- One.
- Whoa.

407
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,844
It's, it's, it's all right.

408
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:14,739
Symbiosis complete.

409
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:17,454
The mainframe is now ambulatory.

410
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,485
How do you feel?

411
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:28,687
Running diagnostics.

412
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,030
Faulty HVAC unit in the Oslo facility.

413
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,923
Data slowdown in the Minsk network.

414
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:34,760
There are currently
nine faulty satellites

415
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:36,695
- in the atmospheric array.
- I meant you.

416
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:38,134
How do you feel?

417
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:42,039
You, the entity known as Ptonomy?

418
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:44,569
There is no Ptonomy, there
is only the mainframe.

419
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,142
Why do I have a mustache?

420
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,309
Oh, they have mustaches,
I just thought...

421
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:52,577
Routing all command
functions to this vessel.

422
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:54,546
Can we eat now?

423
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:57,649
In a moment. I have
to test his reflexes.

424
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:01,620
Slow.

425
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:03,621
Oh...

426
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:17,536
Not sure how much more
money we can throw at this.

427
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:20,639
You know, there are other threats.

428
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:23,975
He destroys the world.
I said that, right?

429
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,154
It's not... me.

430
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,672
I've got bosses and they've got bosses.

431
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,842
Well, I thought I was your boss.

432
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,254
Only at home.

433
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,552
He has a time traveler.

434
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,555
Who?

435
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:38,148
David.

436
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,409
I met her in the astral plane.

437
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:42,726
Uh, what do you mean,
he has a time traveler?

438
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:46,057
She's young, a teenager.

439
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,264
She has skill.

440
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,635
She's with David? How do you know?

441
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:52,737
We spoke.

442
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:57,709
So you had her... and
then you let her go?

443
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:01,680
Like I said, she has skill.

444
00:41:01,682 --> 00:41:03,014
You see,

445
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:06,326
the astral plane exists at the crux

446
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,312
of time and space.

447
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,582
It's, uh, how do you say, um...

448
00:41:10,585 --> 00:41:12,823
a rest stop.

449
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:15,961
I was able to intercept her, but only...

450
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:18,663
for a moment.

451
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,633
So where is he?

452
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:22,666
_

453
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:24,812
Our boy shields his mind from me.

454
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,571
And how does she help him?

455
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:28,707
This time traveler?

456
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:30,709
To answer, I must ask...

457
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:33,151
how do you surprise someone

458
00:41:33,154 --> 00:41:36,517
who can go back in
time and warn himself?

459
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:45,957
Why don't we have a time traveler?

460
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:49,851
David Haller location detected.

461
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,864
That's industrial, low density.

462
00:41:52,866 --> 00:41:55,489
I say we scramble the
jet and we drop a bomb.

463
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:58,702
No, no, it should be a team.

464
00:41:58,705 --> 00:42:01,482
We've got to make sure.

465
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,518
You've trained for this.

466
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:10,493
And the time traveler?

467
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:13,197
Remember: whatever we do...

468
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,300
she can undo.

469
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:17,554
Great. Then we kill her, too.

470
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,640
We have him.

471
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,490
I'll get ready.

472
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:10,691
How big is the team?

473
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:12,626
You don't have to go.

474
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:15,730
I'm going.

475
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:17,798
Why not stay back?

476
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,534
Let us take care of things.

477
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,740
He's not my first boyfriend.

478
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:28,542
He's not even the first
boy to take advantage.

479
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:30,478
There's a job to do.

480
00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:33,748
Revenge is not a job.

481
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,750
It's not that.

482
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:42,656
All that love, it
doesn't just disappear.

483
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:45,826
It must be transformed into an emotion

484
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:48,362
of equal intensity.

485
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,798
That is the law of the universe.

486
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,468
Pretty sure you're making that up.

487
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,470
My dear,

488
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:59,741
I am over 2,000 years old.

489
00:43:59,744 --> 00:44:01,475
I don't make things up.

490
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:03,134
I have wisdom.

491
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:06,514
And my wisdom says you remain here

492
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:09,450
and we will kill him.

493
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,453
No.

494
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:14,688
I have to be there.

495
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:25,315
This should block your brain waves.

496
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:29,503
I've built similar tech into
our fighting friends' helmets.

497
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:31,705
This way, David won't hear us coming.

498
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,117
The David Haller phenomenon is contained

499
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,820
within normal space and time.

500
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:49,690
Outward signs indicate he
is unaware of our approach.

501
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:51,091
Probability of success?

502
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:53,060
67%.

503
00:44:58,934 --> 00:45:00,134
Air support?

504
00:45:00,136 --> 00:45:02,803
At the weigh station, ready to move in.

505
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,271
Spread out.

506
00:45:29,932 --> 00:45:31,832
Clark.

507
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,034
I see him.

508
00:45:34,036 --> 00:45:36,036
Get the hook.

509
00:45:38,707 --> 00:45:41,372
Get ready to move.

510
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,409
Send in air support.

511
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:45,378
We go in ten,

512
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:47,582
nine,

513
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,949
eight, seven,

514
00:45:49,952 --> 00:45:51,785
six,

515
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:53,086
five...

516
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:55,022
...four...

517
00:45:57,197 --> 00:45:59,825
Ground connection lost.

518
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,522
Ground connection...

519
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:23,850
What's up?

520
